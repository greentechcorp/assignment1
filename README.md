Assignment 1
Goals: 
- get acquainted with some basics of a machine learning workflow. 
- familiarise yourselves with useful libraries 
- get to know and work with jupyter notebooks
- learn git

In this assignment we would like you to read the article in this link:
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-an-image-classifier-for-waste-sorting-6d11d3c9c478

And then go through the notebook from this git repo:
https://github.com/collindching/Waste-Sorter

As you will see you will not be required to write code yourselves as you can just run the snippets provided by the author of this notebook. However do not fall into the trap of just scheming over the code that is already there. Being able to read and understand other people's code is a crucial skill, equally important to being able to write code on your own. I would like you to be able to understand every line of code in the assignment. If you have problems with any part of the assignment, ask questions and we will help. 

I would also like for you to read a bit more on the specific solution that has been implemented here and be able to explain why this specific model might be a good idea for image recognition. 

Here I also provide a paper based on which this assignment is designed:

You don't have to read through all of it but if you are interested giving it a quick look might be interesting.
